Hey PyOhio, It's good to be home.

Concept:

I wanted to share what it's like building art and electronics projects with python.

Most of my work is for a very private social organization, It's difficult to discuss.

So I made something up for you.


It's sort of intentionally devoid of artistic vision.
If I were applying for a grant, I'd spend another several hundred words about how
meaningful that was.

You can make it whatever you want, it's more of a canvas for building your own piece.

So far I've made several pieces with it, ranging from the utterly silly to some
which are personally a little more....reflective.

Anyway, without further adieu, here's snow white.

I call it an autoreflector. Cute right? At least when I'm looking, and at least while it's off.

Anyway, Let's turn it on.
